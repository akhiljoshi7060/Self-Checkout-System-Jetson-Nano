# Self-Checkout System Using Jetson Nano

An automated, **vision-based self-checkout system** for fruits and produce using **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**.
It combines **real-time object detection** with **weight measurement** and **cloud database integration** to make supermarket checkout faster and error-free.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* Real-time fruit/produce detection with **YOLOv8 / TensorFlow Lite**
* **Edge inference on Jetson Nano** for low latency
* **Weight sensing** with Load Cell + HX711 + ESP8266
* **Dynamic pricing** (shop owner updates price in database)
* **Cloud Firebase/SQL integration** for storing bills, prices, and transactions

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Components

| Component                       | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Jetson Nano**                 | Runs ML inference at edge              |
| **HP w200 Webcam**              | Captures fruit/produce images          |
| **HX711 + Load Cell + ESP8266** | Measures fruit weight, sends to Jetson |
| **Firebase / Cloud SQL**        | Stores items, prices, and billing data |

**Formula:**

```
Item Price = (Price per weight unit) √ó (Weight measured)
```
